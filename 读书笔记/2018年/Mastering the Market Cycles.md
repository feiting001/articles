## 1.  Why study cycles
    

-   Warren Buffett once told me about his two criteria for a desirable piece of information: it has to be important, and it has to be knowable. macro does matter, but very few people can master it. For most, it’s just not knowable.
    

-   trying to know more than others about what I call “the knowable”: the fundamentals of industries, companies and securities,
    
-   being disciplined as to the appropriate price to pay for a participation in those fundamentals, and
    
-   understanding the investment environment we’re in and deciding how to strategically position our portfolios for it.
    

-   In order to do that (take advantage of discrepancies between “price” and “value.”) successfully, they (value investors) have to (a) quantify an asset’s intrinsic value and how it’s likely to change over time and (b) assess how the current market price compares with the asset’s intrinsic value, past prices for the asset, the prices of other assets, and “theoretically fair” prices for assets in general.
    
-   the greatest way to optimize the positioning of a portfolio at a given point in time is through deciding what balance it should strike between aggressiveness and defensiveness. And I believe the aggressiveness/defensiveness balance should be adjusted over time in response to changes in the state of the investment environment and where a number of elements stand in their cycles.Calibrating one’s portfolio position is what this book is mostly about.
    
-   One of the key words required if one is to understand the reasons for studying cycles is “tendencies.”
