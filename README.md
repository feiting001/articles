# articles

This is the place I start recording my writings uncategorized starting from Sept. 2018.

I used to write materials discontinuously，with my daily thoughts and wonderings scattered everywhere, such as Douban, Wechat，and so on. I never learned anything about coding in my school life, but I always envy those programmers and hackers. Starting from now, I will learn Markdown, Python, etc.,little by little. [Ruan Yifeng](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/home.html) is one of the most famous programmers in China, who used to be a student in World Economy. He loved program when he was in college, and became a specialist in several fields of computer science. He is also an active participant of Chinese Internet life, writing articles continuously in the past decade. He is the benchmark of my future learning and writing.
